#Status App
I recentrly moved in with a colleage from university. In order update each other on what one is doing I build this small app in flutter with a Go backend.
Basicly you post what you are doing (studying and as note dnd 2h, or something like this). Before you so anything I know I know we all have WhatsApp, iMessage, FacebockMessager and five other messaging services. But it was fun building it and having something to do so #funProject.
